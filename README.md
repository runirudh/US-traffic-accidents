Data has 50+ usable features - >

                                Original data has 4 severity levels, with most of the data in levels 2 & 3. 

                                For prediction, we have bundled levels 1 & 2 into Low category , and 3 & 4 
                                
                                into High category, as this skewing would affect the model's learning otherwise.
